# Contributing Guidelines

So, you've decided to contribute to Dent Client. Here's how.

## Code Style
Use the typical Java style like this:
```Java
    public static void Main(String[] args) {
        private int x = 1;
        private int y = 2;
        add(x, y);

    }
    public int add(num1, num2) {
        return x + y;
    }
```

## Imports
Don't do this: `import net.minecraft.*;` 
Do this: `import net.minecraft.client.Mouse`
Because we're trying to keep this kinda lightweight.

## Misc.
SPELLCHECK YOUR STRINGS AND COMMENTS.
